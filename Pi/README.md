**Algorithm used to calculate along with iterations:**

Chudnovsky algorithm


```
1 + 1 = 2 (placeholder for the above mentioned algorithm written more in a style of computer code / pure text rather than symbols)
```

**Uses the following modules:**

* My own created Arbitrary-precision library
* My own created Decimal fixed point / floating point arithmetic library
